# Supply Chain Optimization Using Azure Databricks and Inventory Prediction

## Project Summary

This project focuses on optimizing supply chain management by leveraging Azure Databricks and advanced inventory prediction techniques. The primary objective is to forecast inventory needs, optimize stock levels, and enhance the overall efficiency of the supply chain process for a retail company. By integrating various Azure services, machine learning algorithms, and big data processing techniques, this project aims to provide actionable insights that can lead to cost reduction and improved service levels.

## Tech Stack

- **Azure Databricks:** For big data processing and machine learning.
- **Azure Data Lake Storage:** For storing raw and transformed data.
- **Azure Synapse Analytics:** For data integration, transformation, and querying.
- **Azure Data Factory:** For orchestrating ETL workflows and data movement.
- **PySpark:** For distributed data processing and machine learning.
- **Python:** For scripting and data manipulation.
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** Scikit-learn, PySpark MLlib.
- **Git:** For version control and project management.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Ingestion
- **Data Sources:** Retail sales data, inventory data, and supplier data were ingested from Azure Data Lake Storage into Azure Databricks.
- **Data Loading:** Data was loaded into Databricks notebooks for further processing.

### 2. Data Transformation
- **Cleaning:** The data was cleaned by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and dropping unnecessary columns.
- **Feature Engineering:** New features such as rolling average stock were created to aid in predictive modeling.
- **Data Partitioning:** The transformed data was repartitioned and saved back to Azure Data Lake Storage in Parquet format.

### 3. Predictive Modeling
- **Model Training:** A machine learning model was developed using PySpark MLlib to forecast future inventory needs.
- **Feature Selection:** Relevant features were selected for the model, and the data was transformed into feature vectors.
- **Model Evaluation:** The model was trained and evaluated to ensure its accuracy and effectiveness.

### 4. Data Integration and Analytics
- **Data Integration:** Azure Synapse Analytics was used to integrate and analyze the transformed data.
- **ETL Workflows:** Azure Data Factory was used to orchestrate ETL activities, ensuring data was processed and moved seamlessly between services.

### 5. Model Deployment
- **Model Saving:** The trained model was saved for future use in production environments.
- **Model Inference:** The model was used to predict inventory needs based on new data inputs.

### 6. Documentation and Version Control
- **Version Control:** The entire project was managed using Git, with clean and professional commits.
- **README Documentation:** This README file was created to provide a detailed summary and step-by-step guide to the project.


## Industrial Use Cases

- **Inventory Optimization:** Helps in maintaining optimal stock levels, reducing overstocking, and avoiding stockouts.
- **Demand Forecasting:** Provides accurate predictions of future inventory needs, leading to better demand planning.
- **Cost Reduction:** By optimizing inventory levels, the project can significantly reduce carrying costs and improve profitability.
- **Improved Supplier Management:** Enhances collaboration with suppliers by providing accurate inventory forecasts, leading to better negotiation and procurement processes.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Azure services can be effectively combined with machine learning techniques to optimize supply chain management. The insights derived from this project can lead to significant improvements in inventory management, cost savings, and overall supply chain efficiency.
